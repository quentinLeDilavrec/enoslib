Welcome to EnOSlib's documentation!
===================================

EnOSlib helps you deploy applications on various platforms.

It targets role based deployments and allows you to describe your operations
using tasks.

More pragmatically, with the EnOSlib, you can iterate on your application
deployment and experimental workflow locally before moving to a large testbed
like Grid'5000, or Chameleon. It saves time and energy.
